# Project Goal: 
To develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides real-time and historical insights into the current location and movement of shipping containers, enabling proactive decision-making and improved supply chain visibility.

# Focus Area: Current Position Analysis

# Key Objectives:

# Real-time Tracking:
Visualize the current geographic location of containers on a map using GPS or AIS data.
Display key container details (container number, status, destination, estimated arrival time) alongside the map.
Implement near real time data refreshes to keep the dashboard current.
Location History:
Enable users to track the movement history of individual containers, showing their past locations and routes.
Provide a timeline view of container movement, highlighting key milestones and transit times.
Geofencing and Alerts:
Implement geofencing capabilities to define specific geographic areas of interest.
Configure alerts to notify users when containers enter or exit these defined zones, or when unexpected deviations occur.
Location-Based Performance Metrics:
Calculate and display metrics related to container transit times between specific locations.
Analyze dwell times at ports and other key transit points.
Identify potential bottlenecks or delays based on location data.
Data Integration:
Integrate data from various sources:
SQL
# User-Friendly Interface:
Design an intuitive and easy-to-navigate dashboard that allows users to quickly access relevant information.
Provide interactive filters and slicers to enable users to drill down into specific container data.
Provide map based filtering.
Key Dashboard Components:

# Interactive Map:
Displays the current location of containers with clear markers.
Allows users to zoom, pan, and filter the map.
Displays geofenced areas.

# Container Details Table:
Provides a detailed list of containers with relevant information.
Includes columns for container number, status, location, and other key metrics.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Displays KPIs such as container status, container count by Load status.
Displays number of containers within geofenced areas.
Alerts and Notifications:
Displays a list of active alerts related to container location.

# Expected Benefits:
Improved supply chain visibility and control.
Proactive identification and mitigation of potential delays.
Enhanced customer service through accurate and timely information.
Reduced operational costs through optimized container movement.
Increased efficiency in logistics operations.

# Target Audience:
Logistics managers.
Supply chain planners.
Customer service representatives.
Executive management.
